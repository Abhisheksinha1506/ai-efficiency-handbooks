# AI Efficiency Handbooks - Master Collection

## Overview
This repository is a comprehensive knowledge base for **AI-assisted software engineering**, specifically optimized for tools like **Cursor AI** and **Claude Code**. It contains seven "High-Performance AI Development" handbooks that synthesize professional engineering workflows, "vibe coding" practices, and advanced prompting techniques.

## The Handbook Series

1.  **Ultimate Cursor Rules & Best Practices**: Manual for Global vs. Project rules, `.cursorrules` configuration, and reliability hierarchy.
2.  **Troubleshooting & Reliability**: Dealing with context rot, the "Annoyance-Driven" rule strategy, and debugging checklists.
3.  **Professional Workflows & Scaling**: Managing 50k+ LOC projects using internal memory systems and `TODO.md` loops.
4.  **Claude Code Mastery Guide**: Agentic coding via the Claude CLI, context engineering, and safety hook management.
5.  **Vibe Coding & Prompting Playbook**: High-velocity feature shipping using the "Farmer vs. Chef" philosophy.
6.  **Advanced Reasoning & Meta-Prompting**: Documentation for the "Contemplative Reasoning" and "Antigravity" frameworks.
7.  **Stack-Specific Implementation Guides**: Rules for Next.js, Ruby on Rails, Flutter, and more.

## Core Content Focus
- **Agentic Coding**: How to let the AI operate as a proactive partner.
- **Context Engineering**: Optimizing the files and information the AI sees to prevent hallucination.
- **Rule Management**: Creating surgical, modular rules that ensure AI compliance with project standards.

## Usage
These handbooks are intended to be converted into project-specific `.cursorrules` or `.mdc` files to guide AI agents during the development process.
